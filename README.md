# Fosskok Website

A simple but flexible website framework for the Fosskok art collective.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main webpage with responsive navbar and content sections
- `styles.css` - CSS styling with mobile-first approach
- `script.js` - JavaScript for interactivity and future functionality

## Features

- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- Centered navbar with symmetric menu items
- Single-page application with section switching (no scrolling)
- Mobile-friendly navigation with hamburger menu
- Prepared for future blog functionality
- Ready for interactive people grid

## Sections

The website is divided into four main sections:

1. **Om** - About information for the art collective
2. **Program** - Events and exhibitions
3. **Folka** - Interactive grid displaying all members
4. **Gryta** - Blog functionality where multiple users can post content

Each section is displayed as a separate view with smooth transitions between them.

## Future Development

### Gryta (Blog Functionality)
The framework is prepared for blog functionality where multiple users can post content to different channels. The JavaScript file includes placeholder functions for creating blog posts.

### Folka (People Grid)
The HTML structure and CSS are set up for an interactive grid displaying all members of the collective. The JavaScript file includes a placeholder function for creating person cards.

## Customization

### Colors
You can easily customize the color scheme by modifying the CSS variables in the `:root` selector in `styles.css`.

### Content
Replace the placeholder content in `index.html` with your actual content.

### Images
Add images to the project and reference them in the HTML or dynamically via JavaScript.
